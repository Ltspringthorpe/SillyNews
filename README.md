# SillyNews

SillyNews is a simple Chrome Extension which scans the DOM and makes word and phrase substitutions. The idea was inspired partly by the webcomic [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/), written by Randall Munroe. Check out his comics about internet substitutions [here](http://xkcd.com/1288/), [here](https://xkcd.com/1625/), and [here](https://xkcd.com/1679/).

### Some Sample Substitutions

Enjoy such fun substitutions as:

- Media → Gossipmongers
- Teenagers → Ungrateful offspring
- Wormhole → Stargate
- Instrument → Thingamajig
- Election → Mud throwing contest
- Startup → Baby business
- Is dead → Is pining for the fjords
- Internet → Intertubes
- Scientists → Smarty pants

### Future Ideas

There is one large features I'd still like to add to SillyNews in my spare time. I'd like for users to be able to create their own custom substitutions. The raw functionality would be very simple, but generating the regex expressions to match all versions of the word or phrase, such as singular/plural/past tense/future tense etc, will be challenging.
