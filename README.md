# SillyNews

SillyNews is a simple Chrome Extension which scans the DOM and makes word and phrase substitutions. The idea was inspired partly by the webcomic [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/), written by Randall Munroe. Check out his comics about internet substitutions [here](http://xkcd.com/1288/), [here](https://xkcd.com/1625/), and [here](https://xkcd.com/1679/).

### Some Sample Substitutions
